<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name: Declan Evanson</strong><br>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The purpose of the website being designed for CossiePlay is to finally allow a family-run local business to harness internet exposure in an attempt to drive more people to purchase costumes and attend more events. By improving the amount of people turning up to the events, more people will be spending money at the store getting costumes made. In turn, by driving more people to spend money at the store, profits will improve, and ensures the company continues doing business into the future. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>To measure the success of the website once it is implemented, measuring the amount of unique visitors every month, to get a rough gauge of how much exposure the company is getting, seems adequate. This isn't enough however, as this only shows the amount of people or spiders that have simply looked at the site, and we are trying to get engagement. By viewing the amount of people who signed up to attend one of the companies events, we can get a more accurate representation of how many people are actively using and engaging with the companies new website. Additionally, checking how many order or quotes come in from the buy page will accurately convey how successful the website is.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for the new CossiePlay site will be high school kids and young adults, as the majority of people turning up to events are 35-50 year olds. Engaging the younger generations will ensure the passion for cosplaying does not cease with the older generations. Engaging this specific demographic will be achieved by having a modern design with a UX that closely resembles most modern websites. This means once the user has found the website, it looks and feels familiar, ensuring it appeals to them visually and is easy to navigate.</p>
